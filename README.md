    style="height: 300px">

Geophysicist specializing in the development of methods for determining the inner structure of the Earth from geophysical observations, mainly disturbances in the Earth's gravity and magnetic fields. Developer of open-source software for processing, modeling, and visualizing geophysical data. Advocate for openness in the scientific process and the adoption of best practices in computational research.

## Abstract

Fatiando a Terra (https://www.fatiando.org) is a project for modeling and inversion in geophysics, which is composed of different Python libraries. 
In this opportunity we want to present the Harmonica and Boule libraries. 


Boule implements reference ellipsoids (including oblate ellipsoids, spheres, and soon triaxial ellipsoids), conversions between ellipsoidal and geocentric spherical coordinates, and normal gravity calculations using analytical solutions for gravity fields at any point outside of the ellipsoid. 

Harmonica provides tools for processing, forward modelling, and inversion of gravity and magnetic data. We will show a used case to compute Bouguer gravity disturbance by forward modelling the topography with prisms and interpolate it onto a regular grid at a constant height using the equivalent layer technique.
